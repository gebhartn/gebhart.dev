Well, it's been a long time coming, but I've finally got some time to sit down and write my introductory blog post. I thought I'd start out by talking about the process of building my portfolio site using [Gatsby][1]. It's been an iterative process with a lot of hair-pulling and questionable decisions, but I think I am finally happy enough to call it done.

I attended a coding bootcamp, and one of our very first projects during the very first week of the course was to set up a domain and use a starter template to get our very first portfolio up and running. I thought it was sort of a silly excercise, mostly because the only thing I had to show for myself on my [GitHub][2] were a couple of basic HTML/CSS exercises. As I continued going through the bootcamp I learned some JavaScript, and eventually some React, and with React I discovered [Gatsby][1]. I loved that it was different, and it used this thing called GraphQL that I heard about from some of the other students that had experience as freelance developers. It was exciting to me, because until then I had only ever used things that I was explicitly taught during my coursework, and Gatsby was _just_ different enough for me to learn something new on my own.

I scoured the documentation and dug through the recipes and different templates, I watched some talks, tutorials, and read blog posts and found inspiration when I realized they were also built using [Gatsby][1]. I knew I wanted to write a blog. I wanted to write about the new things I was learning and the patterns I was using, because not only have I learned a lot from reading blog posts, but I have learned a lot from _writing_ about things that I am learning, as I learn them.

Now here I am. I have written myself a nice little portfolio site with a nice little blog using a nice little tool I learned as a blossoming developer, and I'm damn proud of it. Here's to hoping that I stick with it, and not only will I continue to learn and grow, but I vow to document it here, and hopefully teach someone something new.

There's still a lot of work left to do, and as I continue to add new features I will be sure to write about them first!
