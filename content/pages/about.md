Hello, I'm Nicholas Gebhart. I'm a full stack software developer currently based out of Southern California. I spend quite a lot of time at the computer reading and writing about the things I am passionate about.

I am setting out to document and share the things that I've learned in my journey as a software developer and technical writer. My goal is to inspire others and to learn through teaching, so that I continue to grow as a developer and technical human being.
